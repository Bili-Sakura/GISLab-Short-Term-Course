# Proper Reference Guidance

Proper attribution involves giving clear and accurate credit to the original creator of the content. Here are steps and examples on how to properly attribute the professor’s keynote presentation:

## In the Presentation Slides

1. **Title Slide Attribution**:
   - Include a statement on the title slide, such as:

     ```
     This presentation is based on a keynote by [Professor's Name].
     Original presentation by [Professor's Full Name, Title, Institution].
     Used with permission.
     ```

2. **Footer Attribution**:
   - Add a footer to each slide that mentions the original author:

     ```
     Content adapted from [Professor's Name, Year].
     ```

3. **Direct Slide Attribution**:
   - For specific slides directly copied or heavily based on the professor’s slides, add a note at the bottom:

     ```
     Source: [Professor's Name, Original Presentation Title, Year].
     ```

## In Accompanying Notes or Documents

1. **Reference List**:
   - If you provide notes or handouts, include a reference list at the end:

     ```
     References
     [Professor's Name]. (Year). [Original Presentation Title]. Keynote presented at [Event Name], [Location].
     ```
