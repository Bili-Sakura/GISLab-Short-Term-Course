> **Abstract**: Satellite images play a crucial role in humanitarian assistance and disaster response. With the advancement of powerful computer vision algorithms, disaster evaluation can be performed automatically and remotely. However, disasters are unpredictable, creating challenges for data collection. Additionally, accurate analysis requires high-resolution images, increasing the pressure on data acquisition. To address these issues, we present the Generative Foundation Model for Disaster (GFM4D), which is pretrained on existing pre- and post-event remote sensing images, enabling it to synthesize satellite images of events as desired by users. Our model demonstrates strong robustness and reliability in image generation. Notably, we also introduce the Global-scale Building Damage (GBD) dataset, comprising over 1 million images worldwide. Pre-trained segmentation models further trained on our dataset show improved performance.

Satellite images are essential tools in humanitarian assistance and disaster response, providing critical information for assessing and managing the impact of natural and man-made disasters. However, the unpredictable nature of disasters poses significant challenges for timely and accurate data collection. Additionally, high-resolution images, necessary for precise analysis, further complicate the data acquisition process due to their extensive requirements.

Recent advancements in computer vision algorithms have enabled automated and remote disaster evaluation, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of response efforts. Despite these technological strides, the need for high-quality, high-resolution satellite images remains a bottleneck.

To address these challenges, we present the Generative Foundation Model for Disaster (GFM4D). This innovative model leverages existing pre- and post-event remote sensing images to generate synthetic satellite images based on user specifications. The GFM4D model showcases exceptional robustness and reliability, making it a valuable tool for disaster management.

A key contribution of our research is the introduction of the Global-scale Building Damage (GBD) dataset, which includes over 1 million images from around the world. This comprehensive dataset enhances the training of pre-trained segmentation models, leading to significant improvements in their performance.

Our study demonstrates that the GFM4D model not only addresses the challenges of data collection and high-resolution image requirements but also provides a scalable and reliable solution for generating post-event satellite images, thereby enhancing disaster response and management capabilities.
