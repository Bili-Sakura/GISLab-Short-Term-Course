## GBD: A Global-Scale Building Damage Dataset based on Diffusion Model

**Abstrct**: Object Detection of Damaged Buildings in disastrous events is important for aiding and reconstruction. Current approaches for building damage assessment include CNN-based models and transformer-based models. However, these pre-trained models lack general capability and fail in timeliness of detection in terms of disastrous events. In this work, we propose a generative model, ModelName, to manufacture potential post-disaster images from vulnerable regions on a global scale, named GBD. We find that after further training state-of-the-art models on GBD, the performance of models shows great improvements.
