To deploy Stable Diffusion 3 using Docker, you should ensure compatibility with Python 3.10.6. This version has been widely recommended and successfully used for running Stable Diffusion due to its stability and compatibility with dependencies like PyTorch (reddit.com, Matt's Homepage).

Below is the Dockerfile for deploying Stable Diffusion 3:

## Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.10.6

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run sd3_infer.py when the container launches
# CMD ["python", "sd3_infer.py", "--model", "models/sd3_medium.safetensors", "--prompt", "cute wallpaper art of a cat"]
```

## Build and Run Docker Container

1. **Build the Docker image:**

    ```sh
    docker build -t sd3-inference .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**

    ```sh
    docker run -p 4000:80 sd3-inference
    ```
